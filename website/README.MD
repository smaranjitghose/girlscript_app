This is a website to compliment the app built using Flutter for different GirlScript Chapters that is to be used by the community associated with it and to later serve as a template for other tech communities as well. From having the option to portray the members' achievements to announcements regarding various local opportunities, we want it to be knit into a single platform. Programming enthusiasts and even exerienced developers would be able to seek the information they require to be an active part of our community.
