2. When it comes to package version, make sure you use the correct
   package.
3. Try to separate the UI from logic.
4. Improve Documentation, this really helps to understand code.
5. When it comes to naming convention, maintain similarity and stability
   through out the app.
6. If your dart file has more than two widgets try to create separate
   file.
7. When it comes to scale our application, try using ``provider`` or
   something similar to that.
8. Know well about advanced concepts in flutter and try to use them
   properly.
